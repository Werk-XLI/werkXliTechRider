\section{Patch-Plan}

Der Patch-Plan beschreibt den Signalflow von der Audioquelle durch unser IEM-/Stage-Rack bis FOH. \\
In unserem IEM-/Stage-Rack sind 2 8-Kanal-Passiv-Splitter verbaut, die die Signale zum einen in unser Monitor-Mischpult und zum anderen an FOH weiterleiten. \\
Phantomspeisung für Mikrofone und DI-Boxen wird hier durch unser Monitor-Mischpult bereitgestellt.

\subsection{Kanäle für Stage-Rack}
